# OmniFi v1 – Hybrid WiFi Security Enforcement Platform
Hybrid WiFi Analysis and Security Enforcement Toolkit

 A **full-stack WiFi security platform** that integrates real-time monitoring, threat detection, behavioral intelligence, and network enforcement.

---

##  Overview

OmniFi is an advanced **Hybrid WiFi Security Enforcement Toolkit** designed to:

* Monitor wireless networks in real-time
* Detect multiple types of attacks
* Analyze device behavior
* Enforce security policies
* Provide an interactive dashboard

Unlike traditional tools, OmniFi combines:

✔ Client-side detection
✔ Router-side intelligence
✔ Behavioral analysis
✔ Automated enforcement

---

##  Core Capabilities

###  Advanced Threat Detection

* Evil Twin detection (SSID/BSSID tracking)
* Deauthentication attack detection
* DNS spoofing detection
* Rogue DHCP detection
* ICMP redirect detection
* ARP MITM detection
* Captive portal fingerprinting
* Beacon anomaly detection

---

###  Behavioral Intelligence

* Dynamic **trust scoring per device**
* Device baseline profiling
* MAC privacy & spoof detection
* Session hijack detection

---

###  Network Monitoring

* Real-time packet analysis (Scapy)
* Telemetry tracking
* Bandwidth monitoring
* Signal & posture analysis

---

### Security Enforcement (NAC System)

* Policy-based enforcement engine
* Device quarantine & blocking
* Network Access Control (NAC)
* Automated response system

---

### Router Intelligence (Admin Mode)

* Router authentication inspection
* Router sitemap mapping
* OpenWrt client integration
* CVE-based vulnerability insights
* Port scanning & device profiling

---

### Smart Advisor

* Suggests best network to connect
* Evaluates:

  * Signal strength
  * Security posture
  * Active threats

---

### Advanced GUI Dashboard

Built using PyQt with modular panels:

#### Panels:

* Dashboard
* Devices
* Threat Scan
* Network Advisor
* Router Management
* Policy & Enforcement
* Eavesdropping Monitor

#### Widgets:
